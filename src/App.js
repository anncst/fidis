          Don't run (oh), no, don't hide
          Been running from it for the longest time
          So many mornings{Am}, I woke up confused
          In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
          My emotions are naked, they're taking{D} me out of my mind
          Right now, I'm shameless
          Screamin' my lungs out for ya
          Not afraid to face it
          I need you more than I want to
          Need you more {G}than I want to
          Show me you're shameless
          Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
          And I won't erase it
          I need you more than I want to
          I need you more than I want to
          No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
          No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
          No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
          No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
